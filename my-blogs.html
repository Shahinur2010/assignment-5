    <p>1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
        It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
    </p>

    <p>2. There are 5 ways for selecting elements in a DOM using selectors.

              <p>a. getElementsByTagName()</p>

              <p>b. getElementsByClassName()</p>

              <p>c. getElementById()</p>

              <p>d. querySelector()</p>

              <p>e. querySelectorAll()</p>
       </p>

    <p>3. Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>

    <p>4. Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
        Callbacks allow to continue executing code while the operation is being executed in the background. Once the operation has completed, the callback function is called with the result of the operation.
